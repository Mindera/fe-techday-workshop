### Workshop Challenge

#### Setup
- Install node
- Clone project
- Verify everyone is running the project
- Create GraphCMS account in https://app.graphcms.com/signup



---



#### GraphCMS challenge

- Login into GraphCMS

- Create a `New Project` from `Scratch`

- After that we can start building our models


Create `Technologies` from `enum` type:
```
enum TechnologiesList {
    Node
    React
    Angular
    Jquery
    Html
    Css
    Sass
    Graph
  }
```

Create `Project` from `model` type:
```Project
type Project @model {
    description: String @defaultValue(value: "Project description")
    projectImages: [Asset!]! @relation(name: "AssetProjectProjectImages")
    technologies: [TechnologiesList!]
    title: String! @defaultValue(value: "Project title")
}
```

- Test you model on the `API Explorer`

Your service is done! Congratulations!

Lets start coding!

#### React challenge

The goal of the React challange is to create an app in which you can showcase your own projects on a list, and then access each one individually to check the details on a detail page.

The list is already implemented and the implementation will be explained, then it's up to you to create the detail page and connect it to the GraphQL server.

First of all, duplicate the `.env` file, rename it to `.env.local` and fill it with the GraphCMS token and ID:

```
REACT_APP_GRAPH_CMS_FOLIO_TOKEN=<your token>
REACT_APP_GRAPH_CMS_FOLIO_ID=<your graphcms id>
```



#### Deploy

- First you need to generate the distribution build
```
npm run build
```
- Install firebase tools globally
```
npm install -g firebase-tools
```
- Now you need to login into firebase...
```
firebase login
```
- Create a new project on firebase
```
firebase init
```
- Follow the command line instructions, and then
```
firebase deploy
```
